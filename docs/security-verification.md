# OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 Security Verification Record

Audit date: 2026-06-20  
Commit reviewed: `3d97c27018856abeedc2321ed12e6ef313da1fd1`  
Framework: [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) 5.0.0](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) (the version specified for this review; ASVS identifiers can change between releases).  
Reviewers: `Codex`, `electron_ipc`, `worker_model`, and `privacy_build`  

This is an evidence record for the repository at the commit above, not a release approval. Every row inherits the audit date, commit, and named reviewer in the `Reviewer` column. `Not filed` means a follow-up issue is required but was not created as part of this read-only review.

## Verification evidence

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `desktop: npm run check` | Pass |
| `backend: python -m pytest -q` | Pass - 30 passed in 0.21s |
| `desktop: npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=low` | Pass - 0 vulnerabilities |
| `backend: python -m pip_audit` | Fail - `pip_audit` is not installed |

## Record format

Each row supplies the required Status, Reviewer, Date (inherited: 2026-06-20), Commit (inherited: `3d97c27018856abeedc2321ed12e6ef313da1fd1`), Files reviewed, Evidence, Remaining risk, and Follow-up issue. Status is strictly `Pass`, `Fail`, or `N/A`.

## Release-blocking remediation order

1. Remove renderer-driven finalization/paste. Main must own final transcripts, enforce active session/generation/terminal state, and capture/revalidate the intended target before paste.
2. Lock down model installation: allowlist model IDs, constrain canonical paths to a controlled model root, reject symlink/UNC/traversal inputs, and use a pinned integrity manifest.
3. Add strict IPC/config schemas, receiver-side size limits before allocation, security-event logging with redaction/rotation, and desktop negative/integration tests.
4. Establish the release baseline: pinned Python dependencies and scan, signed/provenanced package build, artifact inspection, `SECURITY.md`, and user-facing threat/clipboard limitations.
